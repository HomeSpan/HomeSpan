#          --- Custom Partition Table for HomeSpan ---
#
# Similar to min_spiffs, except that the 128K SPIFF block at the end
# is replaced by a 128K NVS block, and the initial 20K NVS block
# is no longer used. Note this table is designed for use with 4MB Flash.
# To use with 8MB Flash, increase app0 and app1 by 2048K to become 3968K each.
# To use with 16MB Flash, increase app0 and app1 by 6144K to become 8064K each
