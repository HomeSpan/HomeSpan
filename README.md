# Welcome!

Welcome to HomeSpan - a robust and extremely easy-to-use Arduino library for creating your own [ESP32-based](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32) HomeKit devices entirely within the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc).

HomeSpan provides a microcontroller-focused implementation of Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification Release R2 (HAP-R2) designed specifically for the Espressif ESP32 microcontroller running within the Arduino IDE.  HomeSpan pairs directly to HomeKit via your home WiFi network without the need for any external bridges or components.  With HomeSpan you can use the full power of the ESP32's I/O functionality to create custom control software and/or hardware to automatically operate external devices from the Home App on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, or with Siri.

HomeSpan requires version 2.0.0 or later of the [Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32), and has been tested up through version 2.0.9 (recommended).  HomeSpan can be run on the original ESP32 as well as Espressif's ESP32-S2, ESP32-C3, and ESP32-S3 chips.

* **Adds ability to use a non-standard LED as the HomeSpan Status LED**

  * new homeSpan method `setStatusDevice(Blinkable *sDev)` sets the Status LED to the Blinkable object *sDev*
  * allows an LED connected to a pin expander, or any other non-standard LED controller (such as an inverted LED that lights when a pin is LOW instead of HIGH) to be used as the HomeSpan Status LED    
  * see [Blinkable.md](docs/Blinkable.md) for details (including an example) on how to create Blinkable objects
    
See [Releases](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/releases) for details on all changes and bug fixes included in this update.

# External Resources

In addition to HomeSpan resources, developers who are new to HomeKit programming should download Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification, Non-Commercial Version, Release R2 (HAP-R2). This document is unfortunately no longer available from Apple (perhaps because it was last updated July, 2019, and is now somewhat out-of-date).  However, you may be able find copies of this document elsewhere on the web.  Note Apple has not replaced the HAP-R2 document with any other versions for non-commercial use, and Apple's open-source [HomeKit ADK](https://github.com/apple/HomeKitADK) only reflects the original HAP-R2 specs (rather than all the latest Services and Characteristics available in HomeKit for commercial devices).

You ***do not*** need to read the entire HAP-R2 document. The whole point of HomeSpan is that it implements all the required HAP operations under the hood so you can focus on just programming whatever logic is needed to control your real-world appliances (lights, fans, RF remote controls, etc.) with the device.  However, you will find Chapters 8 and 9 of the HAP guide to be an invaluable reference as it lists and describes all of the Services and Characteristics implemented in HomeSpan, many of which you will routinely utilize in your own HomeSpan sketches.

### About the Author

HomeSpan was developed and continues to be maintained and supported by Gregg Berman.  It was originally conceived to solve the pesky problem of not being able to operate an RF-controlled kitchen vent hood with Siri.  I hope you find it useful as well as fun to use.

This is my second large-scale open-source project --- my first was the design of an open-source sytem for operating model railroads using nothing more than an Arduino Uno and Arduino Motor Shield to generate digital command and control (DCC) signals.  Though I have not been involved with the model railroading hobby for many years, videos showcasing my original system (dubbed DCC++), along with detailed tutorials of how it works, are still available on the [DCC++ YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dcc2840/videos).
