# Welcome!

Welcome to HomeSpan - a robust and extremely easy-to-use Arduino library for creating your own [ESP32-based](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32) HomeKit devices entirely within the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc).

HomeSpan provides a microcontroller-focused implementation of Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification Release R2 (HAP-R2) designed specifically for the Espressif ESP32 microcontroller running within the Arduino IDE.  HomeSpan pairs directly to HomeKit via your home WiFi network without the need for any external bridges or components.  With HomeSpan you can use the full power of the ESP32's I/O functionality to create custom control software and/or hardware to automatically operate external devices from the Home App on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, or with Siri.

Requirements to run HomeSpan depend on which version you choose:

|HomeSpan Version | Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager | Partition Scheme | Supported Chips|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
|1.9.1 or earlier | v2.0.0 - v2.0.17 | *Default* (1.3MB APP) | ESP32, S2, S3, C3 |
|2.0.0 or later | v3.0.2 - **v3.3.0**<sup>*</sup> | *Minimal SPIFFS* (1.9MB APP) | ESP32, S2, S3, C3, *and C6* |

<sup>*</sup>HomeSpan has been tested through **version 3.3.0** of the Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager (built on IDF 5.5.0).  Later releases may work fine, but have not (yet) been tested.  Note HomeSpan does not support the use of alpha, beta, or pre-release candidates of the Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager - testing is only done on production releases of the Board Manager.

**ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS**:  Apple's HomeKit architecture [requires the use of a Home Hub](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207057) (either a HomePod or Apple TV) for full and proper operation of any HomeKit device, including those based on HomeSpan.  ***Use of HomeSpan without a Home Hub is NOT supported.***

## ‚ùóLatest Update - HomeSpan 2.1.4 (XX Aug 2025)

### Updates and Corrections

* **Refactored *Pixel* Library for Improved Performance**
  
  * also addresses a latent issue introduced during the original re-factoring of the Pixel library in HomeSpan 2.0.0 that prevented certain pixels strands from operating
  * kudos to @rubillos for identifying the issue and providing a solution
  * IMPORTANT: this fix utilizes IDF functionality only available since IDF 5.3.  As a result:
    
    * **HomeSpan 2.1.4 requires Arduino-ESP32 version 3.1.0 or later**
    * **HomeSpan will *not* compile on prior versions of the Arduino-ESP32 library**

# External Resources

In addition to HomeSpan resources, developers who are new to HomeKit programming may find useful Chapters 8 and 9 of Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification, Non-Commercial Version, Release R2 (HAP-R2). This document is unfortunately no longer available from Apple (perhaps because it was last updated July, 2019, and is now somewhat out-of-date).  However, you may be able find copies of this document elsewhere on the web.  Note Apple has not replaced the HAP-R2 document with any other versions for non-commercial use, and Apple's open-source [HomeKit ADK](https://github.com/apple/HomeKitADK) only reflects the original HAP-R2 specs (rather than all the latest Services and Characteristics available in HomeKit for commercial devices).

### Matter and Thread

There are no plans to make HomeSpan compatible with Matter since HomeSpan was structured entirely around HAP R2.  In addition, both Apple and Espressif have released Matter SDKs for public use, reducing the need for yet another Matter SDK.

Connecting HomeSpan directly to HomeKit via Thread is not planned (and might not even be possible).  However, Thread may be useful for inter-device communication similar to how HomeSpan uses ESP-NOW to implement remote, battery-operated devices.  This may be added at some point in a future release.

### Feedback or Questions?

Please post bug reports or other problems with HomeSpan to the [Issues Board](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/issues).  Please post all other questions about HomeSpan (use, functionality, specs, examples, etc.) or any ideas or recommendations you may have for new functionality, or any general feedback about HomeSpan or HomeKit, to the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/discussions).  For more general questions or feedback not related to a specific HomeSpan issue or function, you can email me directly at [homespan@icloud.com](mailto:homespan@icloud.com).

### About the Author

HomeSpan was developed and continues to be maintained and supported by Gregg Berman.  It was originally conceived to solve the pesky problem of not being able to operate an RF-controlled kitchen vent hood with Siri.  I hope you find it useful as well as fun to use.

This is my second large-scale open-source project --- my first was the design of an open-source sytem for operating model railroads using nothing more than an Arduino Uno and Arduino Motor Shield to generate digital command and control (DCC) signals.  Though I have not been involved with the model railroading hobby for many years, videos showcasing my original system (dubbed DCC++), along with detailed tutorials of how it works, are still available on the [DCC++ YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dcc2840/videos).
