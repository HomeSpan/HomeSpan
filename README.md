# Welcome!

Welcome to HomeSpan - a robust and extremely easy-to-use Arduino library for creating your own [ESP32-based](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32) HomeKit devices entirely within the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc).

HomeSpan provides a microcontroller-focused implementation of Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification Release R2 (HAP-R2) designed specifically for the Espressif ESP32 microcontroller running within the Arduino IDE.  HomeSpan pairs directly to HomeKit via your home WiFi network without the need for any external bridges or components.  With HomeSpan you can use the full power of the ESP32's I/O functionality to create custom control software and/or hardware to automatically operate external devices from the Home App on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, or with Siri.

### Requirements

|Component | Requirement | See Note |
|---|:---:|:---:|
|Current HomeSpan Production Release | **2.1.5** | - |
| Supported Chips | **ESP32, S2, S3, C3, and C6** | [^8266] |
| Minimum Required [Arduino-ESP32 Core](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) | **3.1.0** | [^fail] |
| Latest Core fully tested with HomeSpan | **3.3.1** | [^tested] |
| Minimum Flash Partition Size | **1.9MB** | - |
| Recommended Partition Scheme | **Minimal SPIFFS (1.9MB APP with OTA)** | [^partition] |
| HomeKit Hub | **HomePod or Apple TV** | [^homehub] |


[^8266]:HomeSpan cannot be run on an ESP-8266, though an ESP-8266 can be used as a remote sensor in conjunction with HomeSpan's SpanPoint functionality

[^fail]: The current production release of HomeSpan will fail to compile under any Arduino-ESP32 Core release earlier than the minimum version listed.  However, prior versions of HomeSpan can be compiled and run under earlier versions of the Core.  The README file under the [HomeSpan branch](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/branches/all) for each release provides details on which version of the Core can be used for that release

[^tested]: Later releases may work fine, but have not (yet) been tested.  Note HomeSpan does *not* support the use of alpha, beta, or pre-release candidates of the Arduino-ESP32 Core - testing is only done on production releases of the Core.

[^homehub]: Apple's HomeKit architecture [requires the use of a Home Hub](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207057) (either a HomePod or Apple TV) for full and proper operation of any HomeKit device, including those based on HomeSpan.  ***Use of HomeSpan without a Home Hub is NOT supported.***

[^partition]: This recommendation assumes an ESP device with 4MB of flash memory.  For devices with 8MB or more of flash memory you may choose any partition scheme that provides at least 1.9MB APP space and 1.9MB of OTA space (if using OTA)

### Translated Documentation

A user-created repository containing a Chinese translation of the HomeSpan documentation can be found at [https://github.com/abackup/HomeSpan-Chinese](https://github.com/abackup/HomeSpan-Chinese).  Note HomeSpan is not responsible for the content of this repository - please direct any questions about the content of the translations to the issues page for that repository. 

# External Resources

In addition to HomeSpan resources, developers who are new to HomeKit programming may find useful Chapters 8 and 9 of Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification, Non-Commercial Version, Release R2 (HAP-R2). This document is unfortunately no longer available from Apple (perhaps because it was last updated July, 2019, and is now somewhat out-of-date).  However, you may be able find copies of this document elsewhere on the web.  Note Apple has not replaced the HAP-R2 document with any other versions for non-commercial use, and Apple's open-source [HomeKit ADK](https://github.com/apple/HomeKitADK) only reflects the original HAP-R2 specs (rather than all the latest Services and Characteristics available in HomeKit for commercial devices).

### Matter and Thread

There are no plans to make HomeSpan compatible with Matter since HomeSpan was structured entirely around HAP R2.  In addition, both Apple and Espressif have released Matter SDKs for public use, reducing the need for yet another Matter SDK.

### Feedback or Questions?

Please post bug reports or other problems with HomeSpan to the [Issues Board](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/issues).  Please post all other questions about HomeSpan (use, functionality, specs, examples, etc.) or any ideas or recommendations you may have for new functionality, or any general feedback about HomeSpan or HomeKit, to the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/discussions).

### About the Author

HomeSpan was developed and continues to be maintained and supported by Gregg Berman.  It was originally conceived to solve the pesky problem of not being able to operate an RF-controlled kitchen vent hood with Siri.  I hope you find it useful as well as fun to use.

This is my second large-scale open-source project --- my first was the design of an open-source sytem for operating model railroads using nothing more than an Arduino Uno and Arduino Motor Shield to generate digital command and control (DCC) signals.  Though I have not been involved with the model railroading hobby for many years, videos showcasing my original system (dubbed DCC++), along with detailed tutorials of how it works, are still available on the [DCC++ YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dcc2840/videos).
