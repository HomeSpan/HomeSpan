# Welcome!

Welcome to HomeSpan - a robust and extremely easy-to-use Arduino library for creating your own [ESP32-based](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32) HomeKit devices entirely within the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc).

HomeSpan provides a microcontroller-focused implementation of [Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification Release R2 (HAP-R2)](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/specification/) designed specifically for the Espressif ESP32 microcontroller running within the Arduino IDE.  HomeSpan pairs directly to HomeKit via your home WiFi network without the need for any external bridges or components.  With HomeSpan you can use the full power of the ESP32's I/O functionality to create custom control software and/or hardware to automatically operate external devices from the Home App on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, or with Siri.

HomeSpan is fully compatible with both Versions 1 and 2 of the [Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32).  Under Version 1, HomeSpan can be run only on the original ESP32.  Under Version 2, HomeSpan can be run on the original ESP32 as well as Espressif's ESP32-S2 and ESP32-C3 chips.

* 18 detailed tutorial-sketches with extensive comments, HomeSpan documentation and tips and tricks

### For the HomeSpan End-User

* Embedded WiFi Access Point and Web Interface to allow end-users (non-developers) to:
  * Set up Homespan with their own home WiFi Credentials
  * Create their own HomeKit Pairing Setup Code
* Status LED and Control Button to allow end-users to:
  * Force-unpair the device from HomeKit
  * Perform a Factory Reset
  * Launch the WiFi Access Point
* A standalone, detailed End-User Guide

## ❗Latest Update - HomeSpan 1.4.2 (11/27/2021)

* **Updated for compatability with Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager 2.0.1**
  * Maintains backward compatability with all previous versions

* **Some new methods and options for advance-use circumstances:**

  * Added *optional* second argument to the `setVal()` method that allows the value of a Characteristic to be updated *without* sending notification messages to HomeKit.  Useful for keeping track of duration time when implementing a Sprinkler System - see [HomeSpan Reference Sprinkler](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpanReferenceSketches/tree/main/ReferenceSprinklers) for an example

  * Added `getLinks()` as a new method to SpanService.  Returns a vector of pointers to SpanServices that have been linked to another Service with the addLink() method.  Useful for looping over all linked services, such as checking all valves in a Shower System - see [HomeSpan Reference Shower](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpanReferenceSketches/tree/main/ReferenceShower) or an example

  * Added `setPerms()`, `addPerms()`, and `removePerms()` as new methods to SpanCharacteristic.  Allows the user to modify (set/add/remove) the default permissions for any Characteristic.  Useful for adding/deleting write-permissions for certain Characteristics

  * Added `setPairingCode()` method to the global homeSpan object that allows for programmatically configuring the Pairing Setup Code inside your sketch. See the HomeSpan API for important security considerations when using this function!

See [Releases](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/releases) for details on all changes included in this update.

# External Resources

In addition to HomeSpan resources, developers who are new to HomeKit programming should download Apple's [HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification, Release R2 (HAP-R2)](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/specification/). The download is free, but Apple requires you to register your Apple ID for access to the document.

You ***do not*** need to read the entire document.  The whole point of HomeSpan is that it implements all the required HAP operations under the hood so you can focus on just programming whatever logic is needed to control your real-world appliances (lights, fans, RF remote controls, etc.) with the device.  However, you will find Chapters 8 and 9 of the HAP guide to be an invaluable reference as it lists and describes all of the Services and Characteristics implemented in HomeSpan, many of which you will routinely utilize in your own HomeSpan sketches.
